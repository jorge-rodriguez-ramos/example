# Example of basic use of Github

Sample of AFM data from experiments with Kruno on Jurkat cells, treated with 50 ppm of pastic nanoparticles and control (no nanoparticles). 

I have included: 

1. The raw data of two sessions of force spectroscopy experiments, on the JPK AFM

1. The .tsv files of bulk processing of the force curves with AtomicJ

1. Jupyter notebook with data processing

1. An independent webpage.
